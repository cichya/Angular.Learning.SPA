<h3>Redux principles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>State tree - everything that is changes is store in single object called state</li>
  <li>Action principle - store can be changed only when the action is dispatched</li>
  <li>Reducer - is pure actions which take two arguments: actual state and action to dispatched. For undefined
    action return actual state. In the beginning return initial state.
  </li>
</ul>
